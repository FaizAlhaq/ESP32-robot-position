# ESP32 Robot Positioning System

This project is a closed-loop position control system for a two-wheeled robot using an ESP32 microcontroller. It determines the center point between two obstacles using two ultrasonic sensors and corrects the robot's position by comparing left and right distance readings.

## üìö Background
This project was developed as a final semester assignment in the *System Dynamics* course. It demonstrates the application of feedback control and error correction using real-time sensor inputs and motor control.

## üß© Components Used
- ESP32 Dev Module
- 2x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors
- 2x DC Motors
- L298N Motor Driver Module
- 8x 3.7V Li-ion Batteries
- Jumper Wires, Breadboard

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Software
- Arduino IDE
- C/C++ Programming
- Custom PID-style logic for error correction

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Overview
- The robot reads distance from the left and right ultrasonic sensors.
- If distances are unequal, the system calculates the error and corrects the position by adjusting motor direction.
- Once the left and right distances are equal (or within a defined threshold), the robot stops.
- Real-time sensor readings are displayed via Serial Monitor.
